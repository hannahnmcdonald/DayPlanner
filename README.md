# DayPlanner

<ins> Deployed Application:</ins> https://hannahnmcdonald.github.io/DayPlanner/

**An easy to use day planner application interfaced with moment.js, that allows you to plan your day by the hour and store your appointments into local storage.**

This application uses moment.js for a simple clock on the top of the page and has rows with text inputs for hours of the work day. User can input their plan into the hour row of their choosing and save it to local storage and it will automatically be retrieved on page reload. Rows are also highlighed by color if they are past/present/future.
